> Spec: Piano 3D Visual Enhancement
> Created: 2025-07-23
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the piano player component with a 3D visual appearance to create depth and a more realistic, engaging interface that matches the new 3D button styling throughout the application.

## User Stories

### Visual Consistency for Music Learners

As a music learner, I want the piano keyboard to have a realistic 3D appearance, so that it feels more like interacting with a real piano and maintains visual consistency with the 3D chord buttons.

Currently, the piano keyboard appears flat compared to the newly implemented 3D chord buttons and inversion controls. This visual inconsistency makes the interface feel disconnected. A 3D piano keyboard would create a cohesive visual experience where all interactive elements have depth and tactile qualities, making the learning experience more immersive and enjoyable.

### Enhanced Visual Feedback

As a piano student, I want to see clear visual depth when keys are pressed, so that I can better understand which notes are being played and feel more connected to the instrument.

The current flat design doesn't provide strong visual feedback when keys are pressed. Adding 3D depth with pressed key animations would make it clearer which notes are active, especially when multiple keys are pressed simultaneously. This enhanced feedback helps students better visualize chord structures and improves the learning experience.

## Spec Scope

1. **3D Piano Key Design** - Add visual depth to white and black keys with gradients, shadows, and borders
2. **Key Press Animation** - Implement depression animation when keys are played, similar to chord buttons
3. **Perspective and Layout** - Add subtle perspective to make the piano appear more three-dimensional
4. **Shadow and Lighting** - Implement realistic shadows between keys and under the keyboard
5. **Hover State Enhancement** - Add 3D hover effects that preview the key depression

## Out of Scope

- Changing the piano's functional behavior or note playback
- Modifying the keyboard size or number of keys
- Adding complex animations or transitions
- Implementing skeuomorphic wood textures or materials
- Changing the fundamental layout or positioning of the piano

## Expected Deliverable

1. Piano keys have a raised 3D appearance with proper depth and shadows
2. Keys depress visually when clicked or when playing a chord progression
3. Black keys appear elevated above white keys with realistic positioning
4. The entire piano keyboard has consistent 3D styling that matches other UI elements
