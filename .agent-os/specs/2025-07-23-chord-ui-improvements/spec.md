> Spec: Chord UI Improvements
> Created: 2025-07-23
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Improve the chord interface user experience by converting chord tiles to proper button components, implementing smaller inversion buttons, hiding voice leading by default, and fixing dark mode styling issues. These changes will enhance mobile usability, reduce visual clutter, and ensure consistent theming across the application.

## User Stories

### Mobile User Chord Selection

As a mobile user, I want to tap chord tiles without accidentally selecting text, so that I can quickly build chord progressions without frustration.

Currently, when tapping chord tiles on mobile devices, the browser's text selection feature activates, highlighting the chord name text instead of performing the intended chord selection action. This creates a poor user experience, especially during rapid chord selection or when exploring different progressions. The user must carefully tap to avoid text selection or deal with the text selection UI overlay.

### Music Student Interface Clarity

As a music student, I want a cleaner initial interface with voice leading hidden by default, so that I can focus on basic chord selection without being overwhelmed by advanced features.

New users are presented with voice leading animations and information immediately, which can be overwhelming for beginners who are just learning chord progressions. By hiding these advanced features by default and allowing users to enable them when ready, we create a more approachable learning experience that grows with the user's skill level.

### Dark Mode User Experience

As a user who prefers dark mode, I want all UI elements including the login button to properly match the dark theme, so that I have a consistent and comfortable viewing experience.

The login button currently doesn't adapt to the dark mode theme, creating a jarring visual inconsistency that breaks the immersive dark mode experience. This is particularly noticeable on the authentication pages where the button's styling conflicts with the rest of the dark-themed interface.

## Spec Scope

1. **Chord Tile Button Conversion** - Convert chord tiles from div-based components to proper button elements with appropriate ARIA labels and touch feedback
2. **Compact Inversion Buttons** - Redesign inversion selection buttons (R, I, II) as smaller, more touch-friendly button components
3. **Voice Leading Toggle** - Add a preference to hide voice leading by default with an easy toggle to show/hide the feature
4. **Dark Mode Login Button** - Fix the login button styling to properly respond to dark mode theme changes
5. **Mobile Touch Optimization** - Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate touch targets and prevent text selection

## Out of Scope

- Changing the chord progression logic or music theory calculations
- Modifying the piano keyboard visualization
- Altering the authentication flow or adding new auth methods
- Changing the overall layout or grid structure of the chord interface
- Adding new chord types or progression presets

## Expected Deliverable

1. Chord tiles function as proper buttons on all devices with no text selection issues on mobile tap events
2. Inversion buttons are visually smaller but maintain accessibility with appropriate touch targets
3. Voice leading is hidden by default with a clear toggle option that persists user preference
4. Login button properly adapts to dark mode with appropriate contrast and styling
