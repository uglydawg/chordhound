## 2025-07-23: Authentication Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Security Reviewer

### Decision

Implement multiple authentication methods: traditional email/password, Google OAuth via Socialite, Magic Links, and Auth Codes to maximize user accessibility and reduce friction for different user preferences and technical capabilities.

### Context

Music educators and students have diverse technical backgrounds and preferences. Some prefer traditional accounts, others want social login convenience, and some need passwordless options for classroom environments or shared devices. The multiple authentication approach reduces signup friction while maintaining security.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Email/Password Only**
   - Pros: Simple implementation, full control over user data
   - Cons: Higher friction, password management burden on users

2. **OAuth Only (Google/Apple)**
   - Pros: Reduced implementation complexity, leverages existing accounts
   - Cons: Excludes users without social accounts, vendor dependence

3. **Magic Links Only**
   - Pros: Passwordless simplicity, email-based verification
   - Cons: Email delivery dependencies, potential confusion for some users

### Rationale

Multiple authentication methods accommodate diverse user preferences while maintaining security standards. Google OAuth reduces friction for users already in the Google ecosystem. Magic Links provide passwordless convenience for classroom settings. Auth Codes offer additional verification for sensitive accounts. The Laravel ecosystem provides robust implementations for all methods.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Maximum user accessibility across different technical comfort levels
