## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Piano Students & Self-Learners**: Musicians learning piano who need visual chord references and progression practice tools
- **Music Educators & Teachers**: Instructors who require printable chord sheets and teaching aids for their students

### User Personas

**Music Student** (16-35 years old)

- **Goals:** Create effective teaching materials, help students understand chord theory, save lesson preparation time

## The Problem

### Chord Visualization Complexity

Learning piano chords and progressions can be overwhelming without proper visual aids. Students struggle to understand inversions, voice leading, and the relationship between chords in progressions, leading to slower learning progress and confusion about music theory concepts.

**Our Solution:** Real-time piano keyboard visualization with automatic voice leading optimization and blue note highlighting.

### Limited Practice Materials

Music educators and students lack accessible tools for generating custom chord sheets and practice materials, forcing them to rely on static resources that don't match their specific learning needs or progression preferences.

**Our Solution:** Save/load functionality with printable chord sheets optimized for practice and teaching.

### Complex Music Theory Concepts

Voice leading and chord relationship concepts are difficult to grasp without interactive tools that show how chords connect and transition smoothly between each other.

**Our Solution:** Animated voice leading transitions and blue note calculations that highlight harmonic relationships.

## Differentiators

### Real-Time Voice Leading Optimization

Unlike static chord charts or basic chord apps, we provide intelligent voice leading calculations that automatically suggest optimal inversions for smooth progressions. This results in better-sounding chord progressions and enhanced music theory understanding.

### Comprehensive Authentication & Persistence

Unlike simple web-based chord tools, we provide multiple secure authentication methods (Google OAuth, Magic Links, Auth Codes) with robust chord set management. This results in a professional-grade user experience with reliable data persistence.

### Dog-Themed Educational Experience

Unlike sterile music theory apps, we provide a friendly, approachable interface with dog-themed branding that makes learning music theory less intimidating. This results in increased user engagement and retention, especially for younger learners.
