# ChordHound Logo

To complete the logo setup:

1. Save the provided dog image as `chordhound-logo.png` in this directory
2. The image should be the stylized dog illustration with brown/tan colors and white facial features
3. Once saved, the logo component will automatically detect and use this image
4. If the image file doesn't exist, the application will fall back to an enhanced SVG dog icon

## File Location
- Save as: `/public/images/chordhound-logo.png`
- Format: PNG
- Recommended size: 512x512 pixels or similar square aspect ratio

The logo component has been updated to:
- Check for the existence of the PNG file
- Use the uploaded image when available
- Fall back to an enhanced SVG version with musical elements
- Maintain proper styling and responsive behavior
