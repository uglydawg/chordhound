# ChordHound Learning System Implementation Summary

## Overview

The ChordHound Learning System has been successfully implemented as a comprehensive educational platform for piano chord mastery. This document summarizes the key components and features of the system.

## Architecture Overview

### Database Structure
The learning system uses 8 interconnected tables:

1. **lesson_modules** - Organizes lessons into thematic groups
2. **lessons** - Stores individual lesson content with JSON structure
3. **lesson_progress** - Tracks user progress through lessons
4. **quizzes** - Defines quizzes attached to lessons
5. **quiz_questions** - Stores questions for each quiz
6. **quiz_attempts** - Records user attempts at quizzes
7. **quiz_answers** - Stores individual answers within attempts
8. **achievements** - Defines gamification achievements
9. **user_achievements** - Tracks which achievements users have unlocked
