# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Interactive Chord Learning Pages for Music Learning Site

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Product Name

Chord Mastery Hub

### 1.2 Description

The Chord Mastery Hub is a set of interconnected web pages on a music learning site designed to educate beginner to intermediate piano students on music theory fundamentals, focusing on major and minor chords, inversions, common progressions, and practical teaching methods. It builds on pre-existing content such as chord tables in various keys, inversion examples around C3-C4 octaves, and a structured lesson plan for learning notes, keys, and progressions.

The pages will provide interactive tools for exploring chords (with audio playback), visual tables, transposition features, and guided lessons to make abstract concepts tangible. This will enhance user engagement by combining theory with hands-on practice, reducing overwhelm for learners.

### 1.3 Purpose

-   To democratize music education by offering free, accessible resources for self-paced learning.
-   To help users (students, teachers) understand how notes form chords, how inversions facilitate smooth transitions, and how progressions apply to real music genres (e.g., rock, pop, jazz).
-   To integrate practical pedagogy, encouraging muscle memory, ear training, and creativity through interactive elements.

### 1.4 Scope

-   Core pages: Chord Explorer (interactive tables), Inversion Simulator, Progression Builder, Lesson Plan Guide.
-   Out of scope: Full piano simulator app, user accounts/login (assume anonymous access with optional progress tracking via local storage), advanced topics like modulations or non-diatonic chords.

### 1.5 Target Platform

-   Web (responsive for desktop, tablet, mobile).
